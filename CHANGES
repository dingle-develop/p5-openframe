Revision history for Perl module OpenFrame: 

2.05 Fri Nov 30 13:59:45 GMT 2001
	- Slots can now run remotely via SOAP - see the soap example
	- Applications can now run remotely via SOAP - see the soap_app example
	- OpenFrame::Server::HTTP is now more stable (and has a test)
	- minor bugfixes

2.04 Thu Nov 22 12:26:06 GMT 2001
	- completely changed session implementation: instead of rolling our
	  own we now use the excellent Apache::SessionX (which is not 
	  dependent on Apache, despite the name). The "sessiondir"	
	  config parameter is now obsolete
	- new OpenFrame::Slot::Debugger and example
	- OpenFrame::Server::HTTP now preforks (and can do file uploads)
	- no longer produce warnings when under -w or "use warnings".
          To enable tracing through openframe, enable debugging by
          using: $config->setKey(DEBUG => 1);
	- made sure errors were being passed around (and new error test)
	- new file upload example

2.03 Mon Nov 13 17:12:56 GMT 2001
	- added documentation (all examples, OpenFrame::Application, 
          OpenFrame::Constants, OpenFrame::Slot::*)
	- fixed per-application configuration to actually work
	- OpenFrame::Server::HTTP now takes a port parameter
	  instead of using the general configurations. It also can
          now handle POSTs
        - new Eliza example

2.02 Mon Nov 12 16:56:09 GMT 2001
        - added OpenFrame::Server::HTTP for use without Apache
	- added OpenFrame::Slot::Images and OpenFrame::Slot::HTML
	  to serve static images and HTML files
	- lots of minor fixes
	- added more documentation
	- added hangman example (with and without templates, and test)
	- added webserver example (and test)
	- moved from Java naming (getValue, setValue) to Perlish naming
	  (value(), value($value))
	- removed attribute usage
	- config file has changed significantly, slots carry their own
          configuration now, which means that the config file is much
          cleaner
	- applications dispatched by Slot::Dispatch also get their own
          configuration, which is passed to the application
        - slots can return another slot to push onto the slot list by
          returning a class name rather than an object
        - the slot pipe magically shortens *only* if the response contains
          an ofREDIRECT of an ofDECLINE message code

        - fixed abstract cookies bug
        - added OpenFrame::Server::Direct for testing and other delights
