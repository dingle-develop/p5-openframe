Q. What is an Application Server?

A. An application server is designed to make it easier for you 
   to separate your business logic from your presentation.  This
   means that when it comes time to redesign your web site, or 
   deliver to another device (such as a WAP phone for example)
   you simply need to write the presentation, rather than changing
   the code.

Q. What templating system does OpenFrame use?

A. OpenFrame ships with the Template Toolkit, but OpenFrame
   can operate happily with any templating mechanism.

Q. How can I use a different templating mechanism?

A. All you need to do is write a new Slot, and replace the Generator
   slot in the config file.

Q. Can I use two or more templating mechanisms?

A. You could do.

Q. Under Apache/mod_perl is it possible to use multiple virtual hosts

A. It is now, yes.  Inside a &lt;Perl&gt; section use OpenFrame::Config,
   and then set the config file with:

     OpenFrame::Config->sourceFile( "/path/to/config/file" );

Q. Can we perform clickstream recording using OpenFrame?

A. Yes.  Write a slot that records the contents of an OpenFrame::AbstractRequest to
   a data storage mechanism (database, filesystem, etc, etc)

Q. Can I get OpenFrame to redirect to another server based
   on a particular URL?

A. Yes. Write a slot that returns an AbstractResponse with an ofREDIRECT
   message code and the URL as the message.

Q. Can I link to other things like personalization servers?

A. Yes, Write a slot to connect to your personalization server and return
   an object that is available to the Generator.  It may even be wise to 
   place the information in the session, so that HTML writers have access
   to that personalized data.

Q. Can I write a [WAP/iDTV] application for OpenFrame?

A. Yes. In your application set the mimetype of the data you are delivering
   to the right type, and hey presto, it will work.

Q. Is OpenFrame a content management system?

A. No. OpenFrame is not concerned with content.  Content management systems
   could be built using OpenFrame, but its purpose is to provide mechanisms
   that allow you to write applications.

Q. Is anybody using OpenFrame to write Web Applications?

A. OpenFrame is developed and used by Fotango (www.fotango.com), an online photo 
   sharing service owned by Canon.  All of Fotango's new code is being written to run
   on OpenFrame, and its Fotango Pro (www.fotangopro.com) arm currently operates
   on OpenFrame.

Q. What platforms can OpenFrame run on?

A. To the best of our knowledge anywhere that Perl runs OpenFrame can run.  At
   Fotango development we run OpenFrame on Linux and Apache.

Q. Can I write applications in Java?

A. Yes. OpenFrame can dispatch applications via multiple mechanisms, including
   SOAP.  There is no reason why you couldn't dispatch to a Java application
   via SOAP. 

Q. How much does it cost?

A. OpenFrame is Open Source Software, released under the same terms as Perl.
