The OpenFrame kit for Perl
==========================

Copyright 2001 Fotango Ltd

OpenFrame is an Application Framework for Perl and the Web.  It is designed to
do enough to make your life easier, and provide enough flexibility to make
extending it to do what *you* want it to pretty easily.

Anyway, this is a pretty raw release.  Its ready to use, but it is still lacking
quite a lot of documentation.  Some of the SOAP stuff needs to be reexamined
and that will happen over the next few weeks as we need it.  Patches welcome.

Developers should read lib/OpenFrame/AppWrite.pod and lib/OpenFrame/Slot.pm,
installing-things type people should read lib/OpenFrame/Install.pod.

Regards,
James
