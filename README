NAME
    OpenFrame - An Application Framework for Perl and the Web

SYNOPSIS
      # See the examples/ directory

DESCRIPTION
    *OpenFrame* is an application framework for Perl and any client/server
    style content platform such as the web. It is designed to do enough to
    make your life easier, and provide enough flexibility to make extending
    it to do what *you* want it to pretty easily.

    Lots of progress has been made in cleaning the layers and making the
    framework join together cleanly. All layers can dispatch via SOAP now.
    In addition there are lots of examples of working code that can be
    perused.

    A great deal of documentation is available at the programmer's API
    level, and overviews and tutorials are next on the list of things to do.
    Make sure to check out `OpenFrame::Install'.

    In other news, there is now an OpenFrame website, located at
    http://openframe.fotango.com/. OpenFrame is also available via anonymous
    cvs, see http://openframe.fotango.com/cvs/ for details.
