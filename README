The OpenFrame kit for Perl
==========================

Copyright 2001 Fotango Ltd

OpenFrame is an Application Framework for Perl and the Web.  It is designed to
do enough to make your life easier, and provide enough flexibility to make
extending it to do what *you* want it to pretty easily.

Lots of progress has been made in cleaning the layers and making the framework
join together cleanly.  All layers can dispatch via SOAP now.  In addition there
are lots of examples of working code that can be perused.

Alot of documentation is available at the programmers API level, and tutorials
are next on the list of things to do.

In other news, there is now an OpenFrame website, located at
http://openframe.fotango.com.  OpenFrame is also available via anonymous cvs, 
see http://openframe.fotango.com/cvs/ for details.
