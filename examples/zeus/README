This readme will explain how to set up Zeus to serve OpenFrame
applications:

The Zeus webserver must be configured: create a new virtual server (or
modify an existing one). Set the web server document root to be the
htdocs/ directory, and enable FCGI (along with "Enable FastCGI
programs to be located anywhere"). Now set up a handler to map all
requests for "html" and "gif" to "/zeus.cgi". Apply and commit
the changes, and restart the webserver. That should be it.
