=head1 NAME

OpenFrame::Cookies - An abstract cookie class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use OpenFrame;
  my $cookies = OpenFrame::Cookies->new();
  $cookies->set("animal" => "parrot");
  my $colour = $cookies->get("colour")->value;
  $cookies->delete("colour");
  my %cookies = $cookies->get_all();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<OpenFrame::Cookies> represents cookies inside OpenFrame. Cookies in
OpenFrame represent some kind of storage option on the requesting
side.

Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use
to both store and retrieve information on the client side of the
connection. The addition of a simple, persistent, client-side state
significantly extends the capabilities of Web-based client/server
applications. C<OpenFrame::Cookies> is an abstract cookie class
for OpenFrame which can represent cookies no matter how they really
come to exist outside OpenFrame (such as CGI or Apache cookie
objects).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

The new() method creates a new C<OpenFrame::Cookies>
object. These can hold multiple cookies (although they must have
unique names) inside the cookie tin.

  my $cookies = OpenFrame::Cookies->new();

=head2 set()

The set() method adds an entry:

  $cookies->set("animal" => "parrot");

=head2 get()

The get() method returns a cookie (a C<OpenFrame::Cookie> object)
given its name:

  my $colour = $cookies->get("colour")->value;

=head2 delete()

The delete() method removes a cookie element given its name:

  $cookies->delete("colour");

=head2 get_all()

The get_all() method returns a hash of all the cookies:

  my %cookies = $cookies->get_all();
